# LUFT Unification Analysis Results

This folder contains the results from automated analysis of SDR, SQUID, and cosmic .wav data:
- **Spectrograms**: Visualize resonance and structure.
- **CSV Tables**: Quantify peak frequencies, amplitudes, and LUFT resonance candidates.
- **Markdown Summaries**: Document findings, link to lattice pressure, and compare with Einstein field equations.

## Theory Links:
- **Einstein's 1915/1919 Equations**: \( R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} \)
- **LUFT Extension**: \( R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} + P_L g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} (T_{\mu\nu} + L_{\text{preon}}) \)
- **Resonance Evidence**: 7,468 Hz and harmonics as universal lattice mode.

## How to Use:
1. Add new .wav data to your repo.
2. Run the LUFT analysis script.
3. Review results for universal resonance, lattice pressure effects, and scaling laws.

## Next Steps:
- Compare results to CERN datasets, Chandra/XMM-Newton data, and theory predictions.
- Collaborate and document new signatures of unification in physics.
