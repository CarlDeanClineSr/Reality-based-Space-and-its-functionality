[Transcript of Copilot and Carl’s chat session — August 2025]

> This document preserves the full interactive session for traceability, knowledge-building, and future reference.  
> Copilot and Carl discuss the LUFT Resonance Atlas, project structure, onboarding, math extraction, and collaborative scientific practice.  
>  
> **Session topics include:**  
> - Project documentation and onboarding best practices  
> - README, Start Here, and summary table templates  
> - How visitors experience the repo  
> - Scrutiny and skepticism of unification ideas  
> - Practical recommendations for organization and AI-to-AI collaboration  
> - Strategies for extracting mathematical content from “New Text Document” files  
> - Copilot’s offer to write a math-extraction script  
>  
> **User’s personal instruction/context:**  
> “This project is about Unification and structure and dynamics of the Underlaying construction and movements of energy's and fundamental aspects of space and time, energy, matter. etc.”
