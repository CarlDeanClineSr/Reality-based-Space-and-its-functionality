 ABSTRACT
 GOODS-S Deep/JWST NIRSpec MultiObject Spectroscopy
 Science Target
 (3) 1287_trim_final_clean
 (3) 1287_trim_final_clean
 We will conduct an ambitious deep-field survey to study the formation and evolution of galaxies from z  12 to z  2.  Our program combines NIRSpec,
 NIRCam, and MIRI data, alongside the deepest data from HST, Chandra, ALMA, and JVLA, to produce an unprecedented view of high-redshift
 galaxies.  The program is a collaboration of the NIRSpec and NIRCam GTO teams, and it combines imaging and spectroscopy as well as full use of
 coordinated parallel observations to get the best out of all three instruments.  Indeed, to pursue a detailed understanding of galaxy evolution, the
 combination of imaging and spectroscopy is critical.  By bringing these data sets together on a single field, we will carry out systematic
 investigations far beyond the sum of the parts.
 This survey will provide the rest-frame optical data of sufficient area, depth, and spectral resolutions to map galaxy population properties, including
 the joint distribution of stellar mass, luminosity, star formation rate, stellar ages, sizes, metallicity, nuclear activity, gas kinematics, and outflows,
 over a wide range of redshifts.  Broadly speaking, spectroscopy (at R = 100, 1000, and 2700) provides precise and robust redshifts, measurement of
 the stellar continuum, and emission lines to z  10 and beyond. The emission lines allow us to diagnose the galaxiesâ€™ star formation rate (SFR),

 metallicities, chemical abundances, the ISM dust-reddening, and the ISM excitation, including signatures of AGNs. Low-resolution spectroscopy
 (R=100) for the brighter objects can also diagnose the stellar populations (especially the stellar age distribution). High-resolution spectroscopy
 (R=2700) can diagnose internal galaxy kinematics and outflows.
 The multi-wavelength NIRCam imaging will allow the detection, selection and characterization of galaxies to z = 15 and perhaps beyond.  It will
 determine colors, morphological structure, and color gradients, while supplying photometric redshifts, stellar mass, and star formation rate estimates
 along with measures of equivalent widths of the strongest emission lines. The depth reached is unparalleled and will lead to luminosity functions to
 substantially higher redshift and lower mass than can be done with HST.  Deep MIRI imaging will enable a rest-frame infrared view of subset of our
 sample, testing the assumptions of our UV/optical modeling and revealing heavily obscured stellar populations and nuclear activity.  Combination
 with external data from Chandra, JVLA, and ALMA will further explore nuclear activity and dusty star formation. We expect that this carefully
 constructed survey will provide a primary legacy dataset for many years to come.
 OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
 This file contains part of the "NIRSpec follow-up" phase of the overall program and specifically includes the NIRSpec DEEP/JWST observations
 with NIRCam imaging in parallel.
 These observations have an "on hold" special requirement. The scheduling requirement is that the first observation in this file should be done at least
 60 days after the last observation in the NIRCam "pre-imaging" program 1180 to allow time for data analysis and MSA configuration set-up.
 *Deep/JWST**
 NIRSpec GTO team observations of GOODS-S with NIRCam in parallel.
 For V3PA=310 (NIRSpec MSA PA=88.49).
 Note all positions may need to be changed for any other PA.
 **A note on NIRSpec MSA catalog and configurations**
 A dummy, very small catalog was used to prepare these configurations to avoid the problem of slow loading of APT files with large catalogs used in
 many MSA configurations.
 A real target catalog is included in the MPT part of the APT file, but was not used in these dummy configurations.
 The actual targets entering the MSA shutters will be defined, with target prioritisation, only after the instrument distortion is characterized during
