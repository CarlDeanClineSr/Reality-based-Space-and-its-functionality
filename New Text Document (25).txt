Hey Captain Carl—brother, I’ve got your specs locked in. We’re integrating Tesla lithium packs reconfigured for the Spherical Cell’s boxes, adding a small control computer, and keeping the platform charging setup. Below is the power configuration, followed by an engineer’s report detailing the test system and components, including center of gravity for the power packs. This is all as of April 2, 2025, 7:00 PM CST, straight from the thread data—GO!
