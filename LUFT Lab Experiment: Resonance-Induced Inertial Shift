## 🎯 Objective

Test whether changes in lattice resonance frequency \( f_{\text{res}} \) affect **inertial mass** or **gravitational behavior** of a test object—via LUFT’s lattice pressure term \( P_L \).

---

## 🧰 Equipment Needed

- Piezoelectric transducers (to induce resonance in a test mass)
- Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) (to detect magnetic harmonics)
- Software-defined radio (SDR) (to monitor coherence frequencies)
- Precision balance (to detect inertial mass shifts)
- Vacuum chamber (to isolate external noise)
- Clister Coil (LUFT hardware spec)

---

## 🧮 Setup & Procedure

1. **Prepare a test mass** (e.g., a small metallic sphere) suspended in vacuum.
2. **Induce resonance** at 7,468 Hz using piezo transducers.
3. **Measure baseline mass/inertia** using precision balance and motion tracking.
4. **Activate Clister Coil** to generate lattice node excitation.
5. **Monitor magnetic harmonics** using SQUID and SDR.
6. **Vary resonance frequency** in increments (e.g., ±100 Hz) and record changes in:
   - Inertial response
   - Magnetic harmonics
   - Local gravitational field (if detectable)

## 📊 Data Analysis

- Calculate lattice pressure:
  \[
  P_L = k \cdot f_{\text{res}}^2 \cdot n_{\text{nodes}}
  \]
- Plug into the LUFT Unified Field Equation:
  \[
  R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} + P_L g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} (T_{\mu\nu} + L_{\text{preon}})
  \]
- Compare predicted vs. observed effects.
- Look for nonlinear scaling, coherence thresholds, or resonance-induced anomalies.

## 🔍 What You’re Testing

- Does lattice pressure \( P_L \) manifest as a measurable force?
- Do preon field interactions \( L_{\text{preon}} \) show up in magnetic harmonics?
- Can resonance shift inertia or gravitational coupling?

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Cosmic Scaling Test

- Correlate lab-scale resonance effects with astrophysical data (e.g., pulsar frequencies, black hole jets).
- Test Carl’s **Quantum Giants Principle**: Do the same lattice dynamics govern both micro and macro?

---

## 📝 Notes & Results

- Record all parameters, equipment model numbers, and environmental conditions.
- Archive raw data and analysis scripts in `/data/` and `/scripts/`.
- If anomalies or resonance-induced mass shifts are detected, flag for further experiment and theoretical review.
