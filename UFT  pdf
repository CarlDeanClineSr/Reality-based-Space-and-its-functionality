 The quantum problem
 Feynman Wilson Gauss Ising Bogoliubov Higgs Cite
 A quantum problem with Hamiltonian H is completely specified if
 one can compute the unitary evolution operator
 U(0,T) = ei RT
 0 dtH(t)
 There are path integral representations for this operator. All our
 study starts from here.
 The finite temperature quantum problem is completely understood
 if one computes the partition function
 Z(β) = Tre−Rβ
 0 dtH(t),
 which is formally the same problem in Euclidean time. The same
 path integral suffices to solve this problem.

 A path integral is matrix multiplication
 Define δt = T/Nt The amplitude for a quantum state |x0 at
 initial time 0 to evolve to the state |xN at the final time T can be
 written as
 αN|U(0,T)|α0 =
 αN|U((N −1)δt,T)|ψN−1
 ψ1,ψ2, ,ψN−1
 ψN−1|U(δt,(N −1)δt)|ψN−2
 ψ1|U(δt,0)|α0 ,
 where we have inserted complete sets of states at the end of each
 interval. The notation also distinguishes between the states at the
 end points and the basis states |ψi at the intermediate points.
 This sum over all intermediate states is called the path integral.
 The choice of the basis states |ψi is up to us, and we can choose
 them at our convenience.

 Choosing the basis states
 Feynman Wilson Gauss Ising Bogoliubov Higgs Cite
 If the basis states |ψi are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian then
 ψi+1|U(ti + δt,ti)|ψi = e−iEiδt/ℏδψi+1,ψi
 .
 The result looks trivial because the hard task of diagonalizing the
 Hamiltonian is already done. In any other basis the path integral is
 non-trivial.
 By choosing position eigenstates as the basis, Feynman [1] showed
 that the infinitesimal evolution operator for a single particle is
 given by
 x| U(0,δt)|y = eiδtS(x,y),
 where S(x,y) is the classical action for a trajectory of the particle
 which goes from the point x at time 0 to the point y at time δt.
 For a spin problem one may use angular momentum coherent
 states, for fermions Grassman coherent states. The results are
 similar.

 Since T = exp[−δtH], the two operators commute, and have the
 same eigenvectors. If the eigenvalues of T are called λi, then the
 eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are Ei = −(logλi)/δt.
 If we are to recover a finite Ei when δt → 0, then logλ must go to
 zero. The correlation length in the problem is ξ = 1/logλ, so
 this must diverge in order to give finite Ei. Therefore the
 continuum limit corresponds to a critical point.

 Algorithm for computing energies
 For a new formulation of quantum mechanics we have a trivial
 algorithm for computing the energy. It exploits the simple fact that
 given a randomly chosen unit vector |φ, the matrix element
 φ|Tn|φ tends to λn
 0 as n → ∞.
 1. Choose a source. At one time slice construct a random linear
 combination of basis states: |φ0 .
 2. Choose a path configuration, i.e., a random |φj on each
 lattice site (jδt) with probability given by T. Construct a
 measurement of the correlation function C0j = φjφk .
 3. Repeat step 2 as many times as feasible and construct the
 mean C0j =φ0|Tj |φ0 (since |φj are chosen with
 appropriate weight, the mean suffices).
 4. Plot log C0j against j. At sufficiently large j the slope gives
 −E0δt. Alternatively, find a plateau in the local masses
 mj =log(C0,j+1 /C0j ).

 Quantum field theory
 Feynman Wilson Gauss Ising Bogoliubov Higgs Cite
 Quantum mechanics of a single particle is a 1-dimensional field
 theory. The (Euclidean) Feynman path integral is
 ∞
 Z = Dxexp −
 −∞
 dt S(x) ,
 where S is the action and the integral over an x at each time is
 regularized by discretizing time.
 We extend this to a quantum field theory in dimension D. If the
 space-time points are labelled by x, and the fields are φ(x), then
 the Euclidean partition function is
 Z = Dφexp − dDxS(φ) ,
 where S is the action density and the integrals may be regulated
 by discretizing space-time.

 The lattice and the reciprocal lattice
 In the usual perturbative approach to field theory, the computation
 of any n-point function involves loop integrals which diverge.
 These are regulated by putting a cutoff Λ on the 4-momentum.
 When space-time is regulated by discretization, then the lattice
 spacing a provides the cutoff Λ = 1/a.
 We will take the discretization of space-time to be a regular
 hypercubic lattice, with sites denoted by a vector of integers
 x =aj. When fields are placed on such a lattice, φ(x), the
 momenta are no longer continuous, but form a reciprocal lattice.
 k = 2π
 a
 l,
 where the l are integers. The physics at all points on the reciprocal
 lattice are equivalent.

 Fourier transforms and the Brillouin zone
 In practice our lattice will not be infinite, but a finite hypercube
 with, say, ND sites. At each site, x, on the lattice, let us put a
 complex number φ(x). We can put periodic boundary conditions,
 φ(x) = φ(x + ˆN). Next, we can make Fourier transforms
 φ(k) =
 φ(x)eikx, φ(x) = 1
 ND
 k 
φ(k)e−ikx,
 x
 where k = 2πl/N, and l have components taking integer values
 between 0 and N or −N/2 and N/2. One sees that the boundary
 condition allows components only inside the Brillouin zone, i.e.,
 the region −π/a ≤ kµ ≤ π/a. Any k outside this is mapped back
 inside by the periodicity of the lattice.

 The great unification
 Feynman Wilson Gauss Ising Bogoliubov Higgs Cite
 The renormalization procedure will be to take the continuum limit
 a →0(i.e., Λ → ∞) keeping some physical quantity fixed, such as
 a mass, m. If this is fixed in physical units, then in lattice units it
 must diverge as a → 0. This corresponds to a second order phase
 transition on the lattice.
 A lattice field theory in Euclidean time and D dimensions of space
 is exactly the same as a statistical mechanics on a D + 1
 dimensional lattice. Here is the precise analogy—

 Divergences and critical exponents
 Scaling of free energy at a critical point (Tc,Pc)
 F(T,P) = paf t
 pb p=P−Pc, t=T−Tc.
 The scaling form implies power law divergence of the specific heat
 (t−α), order parameter (t−β and p−δ) and order parameter
 susceptibility (t−γ) at the critical point. There are various relations
 between these critical exponents since the scaling form contains
 only two exponents (see [3]).
 Also there is scaling of the correlation function—
 G(r,T,p = 0) = r(2−d−η)g r
 t−ν .
 At the critical point the correlation length diverges. The scaling
 form implies that
 ξ ∝t−ν,
 G(r,t = 0,p = 0) ∝ 1
 rη+d−2 .

 Coarse graining and the Renormalization Group
 ξ
 If the correlation length of a system is ξ, then one can
 try to define coarse grained variables by summing over
 blocks of sites. When the block size becomes larger
 than ξ, the problem simplifies.
 A renormalization group (RG) transformation is the following—
 1. Coarse grain by summing the field over a block of size ζa, and
 scale the sum to the same range as the original fields. This
 changes a → ζa.
 2. Find the Hamiltonian of the coarse grained field which
 reproduces the thermodynamics of the original system. The
 couplings in the Hamiltonians “flow” g(a) → g(ζa) = g′.
 3. The flow follows the Callan-Symanzik beta-function
 B(g) = −∂g
 ∂ζ ,
 (note the sign). A fixed point of the RG has B(g) = 0.

 Linearized Renormalization Group transformation
 Assume that there are multiple couplings Gi with beta-functions
 Bi. At the critical point the values are Gc
 i . Define gi = Gi − Gc
 i .
 Then,
 Bi(G1,G2,
 ) =
 Bijgj + O(g2).
 j
 Diagonalize the matrix B whose elements are Bij. In cases of
 interest the eigenvalues turn out to be real.
 Eigenvectors corresponding to negative eigenvalues are called
 relevant operators, for positive eigenvalues, the eigenvectors are
 called irrelevant operators, those with zero eigenvalues are called
 marginal operators.
 If an eigenvalue is y then the corresponding eigenvector v → ζ−yv
 under an RG scaling by factor ζ. The eigenvalues are called
 anomalous dimensions. Marginal operators correspond to
 logarithmic scaling.

 Probability theory as a trivial case of field theory

 We can always shift our definition of x so that x = 0.
 It is useful to introduce the moment generating function
 Z(j) =

 n! = dxexjP(x).

 The derivatives of Z(j) give the moments. Now define the
 characteristic function F(j) = logZ(j). The derivatives give
 cumulants. We will use the notation
 x2 = d2F(j)
 dj2

 j=0
 The Hamiltonian of statistical mechanics is analogous to
 h(x) = logP(x). Then Z(j) is the partition function, and F(j) the
 free energy. The derivatives of F give expectations of connected
 parts; these are the cumulants.

 faster, we find that the RG flows to the Gaussian fixed point

 theorem.
 Subtleties may occur if σ2 = 0, with extensions to the case when
 all the cumulants up to some order are zero. Other subtleties arise
 when the distributions are fat-tailed and all the cumulants diverge.
 Other RG methods are needed for these special cases.

 Generating functions in field theory
 Any integral with a non-negative integrand can be treated as a
 D =0field theory. Some of the tricks one plays with integrals can
 be generalized to field theories.
 In any field theory it is useful to extend the path integral to a
 generating functional of correlation functions—
 Z[J] = Dφexp − dDx S(φ)+J(x)φ(x) ,
 The connected parts of correlation functions are recovered as usual
 by taking functional derivatives—
 C(z,z′) = 1
 Z[J]
 δ2Z[J]
 δJ(z)δJ(z′) J=0 
.
 These are clear generalization of the notions of the moment
 generating function and the characteristic function.

 variable, σi = ±1 at each site, i, of the lattice. The Hamiltonian is

 We may put periodic boundary conditions on the lattice through
 the condition that σN+1 = σ1. We write β = J/T.
 This can be solved by introducing the transfer matrix [2]
 T(β) = eβ e−β
 e−β eβ .
 Since Z(β) = TrTN, the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix
 completely specify the solution. We find
 Z(β) = 2N (coshβ)N +(sinhβ)N .
 The system becomes ordered only in the limit β → ∞.

 Power counting
 Feynman Wilson Gauss Ising Bogoliubov Higgs Cite
 Consider the relativistic quantum field theory of a single real scalar

 ield φ. The Lagrangian density, L, can be written as a polynomial
 in the field and its derivatives. One usually encounters the terms
 L = 1
 2∂µφ∂µφ+ 1
 2M2φ2 + g3
 3! φ3 + g4
 4! φ4 +
 Let us count the mass dimensions of the fields in units of a length
 L or a momentum Λ. Since the action is dimensionless,
 [L] = L−D = ΛD. The kinetic term shows that
 [φ] = L1−D/2 = ΛD/2−1.
 The couplings have dimensions
 M2 = L−2=Λ2,
 [g3] = L(D−6)/2 = Λ(6−D)/2,
 [g4] = LD−4 =Λ4−D.

 The upper critical dimension
 For each operator in the theory there is a certain dimension at
 which the coupling is marginal. This is called the upper critical
 dimension, Du. The coupling gr corresponding to the operator φr
 has
 Du = 2r
 r −2 .
 The mass is a relevant coupling in all dimensions, g3 is relevant
 below Du = 6, g4 below Du = 4. All other operators are irrelevant
 in D =4. Derivative couplings are relevant (the kinetic term is
 marginal) in all dimensions.
 Bogoliubov and Shirkov [5] set out power counting rules for
 divergences of loop integrals. It turns out that for D > Du an
 operator is unrenormalizable; at D = Dc the operator gives a
 renormalizable contribution, and for D < Du the theory is
 super-renormalizable.
 SG

 Field theory is not statistical mechanics
 Divergences in statistical mechanics are due to long-distance
 physics. In field theory they are due to short distance physics.
 Therefore, in statistical mechanics it is the power of L which
 counts. For field theory, it is instead the power of Λ which
 determines which terms are important.
 This is also reflected in the differences in the physical meaning of
 RG transformations in the two cases. The critical point in
 statistical mechanics is a point in the phase diagram where the
 correlation length actually becomes infinite. In field theory the
 critical point can be reached for any mass of the particle by scaling
 the lattice spacing to zero (momentum cutoff to infinity).

 When m =0 the two-point function of scalar field
 theory, G, vanishes at the center of the Brillouin zone

 there is only one long distance mode when a → 0.
 At small k one has G ≃ k2[1+O(k2a2)]. Symanzik

 When the hopping parameter κ is large we may expand around

 when κ →0 we may make a hopping parameter expansion around
 a solution in which the sites are decoupled.
 When λ →∞the field at the scale of the cutoff must sit at the
 minimum of the potential, so the model looks like the Ising model.
 From our earlier discussion, we expect that the critical exponents
 of scalar field theory must be the same as that of the Ising model,
 i.e., the two are in the same universality class.

 Feynman Wilson Gauss Ising Bogoliubov Higgs Cite
 In general the theory is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations.
 The algorithm is the following—
 1. Start from a randomly generated configuration of fields,
 φ(x), on the lattice.
 2. At one lattice site, x, make a random suggestion for a new
 value of the field, φ′(x).
 3. Make a Metropolis choice as follows. If the change in the
 action, ∆S, due to the change in the field is negative, or
 exp(−β∆S) is smaller than a random number r (uniformly
 distributed between 0 and 1) then accept the suggestion.
 Otherwise reject it.
 4. Sweep through every site of the lattice repeating steps 2, 3.
 5. At the end of each sweep make measurements of the
 moments of the field variables.
 6. Repeat from step 2 as many times as the computational
 budget allows.

 The theory of interacting bosons in D = 2 has a non-trivial critical
 point corresponding to the Ising model. RG trajectories lying
 anywhere on the critical surface are attracted to this. Since the
 scalar field in D = 2 is dimensionless, an infinite number of
 couplings, g, in addition to κ and λ, need to be tuned to get to it.

 Notation for lattice theories
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 1. The lattice spacing will always be written as a except when we
 use units where a = 1. When quantities with different
 dimensions are equated, it will mean that each quantity is
 made dimensionless by multiplying by appropriate factors of a
 and a is set to 1. For example, 2π +m = 2π/a+m.
 2. In contexts where there is no confusion, we will use the
 notation x, y, etc., to denote either a point in continuum
 space-time, or on the lattice.
 3. If we need more clarity, then sites on the lattice will be
 denoted by vectors of integers i, j, etc..
 4. To specify links on the lattice, we need to specify the lattice
 point x and a direction . Directions will be denoted by Greek
 symbols , ν, etc.. Unit vectors in these directions will be
 written as ˆ, ˆ ν, etc.. As a result, the nearest neighbours of x
 are x + ˆa.

 Notation for groups
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 1. Group indices are denoted by Greek symbols α, β, etc..
 2. Generators of group algebra are denoted λα, and can be
 represented by traceless Hermitean matrices. They satisfy the
 algebra [λα,λβ] = ifαβγλγ, where f is called the structure
 constant. An algebra element, A = Aαλα, is a linear
 combination of the generators with Aα real.
 3. Generators are normalized so that Tr(λαλβ) = δαβ/2
 4. Members of the group are exponentials U = exp(iA). In the
 representation where A are traceless Hermitean, U are unitary,
 i.e., UU† = 1. For example, the Wigner D matrices are
 representations of the rotation group O(3).
 5. Characters of group elements are χr(U) = TrU, so they
 depend on the representation, r. For example, for rotation
 through a fixed angle, the traces of Wigner D matrices
 depend on the angular momentum L.

 The center of a group
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 1. We define the center of a group to be those elements, z,
 which commute with all elements of the group, i.e., zU = Uz
 for any U.
 2. The center of a group is non-empty because the identity is
 always a member of the center.
 3. Since zU = Uz, we find that U−1z−1 = z−1U−1 for any U in
 the group. So, if z is in the center then z−1 is also in the
 center.
 4. The center elements obey all other properties which a group
 must have since they are elements of a larger group.
 5. Hence the center of a group is an Abelian subgroup.

 What is a gauge field?
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 Minimal coupling of a gauge field Aµ = Aα µλα (λα are generators
 of the gauge group) means that the momentum operator is
 (pµ −eAµ)ψ = (i∂µ −eAµ)ψ.
 So Aµ is involved in parallel transporting the wave-function by an
 infinitesimal amount in the direction . A change in
 Aµ(x) → Aµ(x)+∂µf(x), i.e., a gauge transformation is
 unphysical and can be absorbed into an equally unphysical phase
 of ψ.
 On a lattice there are no infinitesimal displacements. The
 derivative operator is replaced by a finite difference. The parallel
 transporter must be replaced by the analogous finite quantity. This
 is the (group valued) link variable
 Uµ(x) = exp(iaAµ).
 SG

 Gauge transformations
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 On a lattice we must now promote the algebra valued local gauge
 function f (x) to a local group-valued field V(x) = exp[if (x)]. The
 derivative of the function in a transformation means that we must
 use the function at two points. An obvious generalization is
 Uµ(x) → V(x)Uµ(x)V†(x + ˆa).
 If we parallel transport a state across a path (x1,x2,
 xN), where
 xl+1 = xl + ˆla, then the relevant field and its gauge transform
 are—
 N−1
 U(x1,x2,
 xN) =
 l=1
 Uµl
 (xl) → V(x1)U(x1,x2, xN))V†(xN).
 If we go around a closed loop (x1 = xN) then the gauge
 transformation is purely local. The trace of a closed loop
 U(x1,x2,x3,
 , x1) is then gauge invariant. These are the only
 gauge invariant quantities that one can build.

 The Wilson action S = β x, ≤ν ReTr[P ,ν(x)−1]
 The Wilson action is written in terms of a plaquette, which is the
 smallest loop on a hypercubic lattice—
 Pµν(x) = U(x,x + ˆa,x + ˆa+ˆ νa,x + ˆ νa,x)
 = Uµ(x)Uν(x + ˆa)U†
 µ(x + ˆ νa)U†
 ν(x).
 To leading order in a the exponents of Uν(x + ˆa) and U† ν(x) give
 the ∂µAν term. Using the Baker Campbell Hausdorff formula
 exey = ex+y+[x,y]/2,
 we recover the field commutators for non-Abelian fields. Putting
 all of it together
 Pµν(x) = exp ia2∂µAν(x) −ia2∂νAµ(x) + a2[Aµ(x),Aν(x)] + O(a4) .
 The trace gives 1 + a4FµνFµν +O(a6), thus reproducing the
 continuum Yang-Mills’ action.

 The partition function Z(β) = 
x, dU(x)exp[−S]
 The integrals in the partition function are Haar integrals over the
 gauge group. They are normalized and translation invariant so that
 dU =1,
 dUU =0, dUf(U)= dUf(UV),
 where V is a fixed group element. Under the Haar measure group
 characters are orthogonal, i.e.,
 dUχ∗
 p(U)χq(U) = δpq,
 where p and q label representations, and the star denotes complex
 conjugation. Given a complex valued function on the group, f (U),
 we can perform harmonic analysis (Fourier transforms) on the

 A strong coupling expansion
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 In the limit β → 0 one has exp(−S) → 1 so that Z = 1. The
 strong coupling expansion consists of corrections around this
 limit. This uses the following facts about group integrals—
 dUχr(U) = δr0, dUχr(VU)χs(U†W) = δrs 
1
 dr 
χr(VW),
 where dr is the dimension of the representation r, and r = 0 is the
 trivial representation, U = 1.
 For a plaquette, P, we use the observation that
 
 e−βP = c0(β)
 1+
 drar(β)χr(P)

 
 ,
 where the functions ar can be computed, and the leading power of
 β increases with r. We see that the only contributions to Z come
 from closed surfaces of plaquettes.

 Other methods
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 Other methods available for dealing with the Wilson action are
 1. An expansion around β → ∞, i.e., the weak coupling
 expansion. Such a perturbation expansion on the lattice has
 more vertices than the continuum expansion. As a result, high
 order computations become difficult. The most important
 result from lattice perturbation theory is the computation of
 the beta-function. This gives a check on the universality of
 the function up to two-loop order, and thereby a relation
 between Λlat and ΛMS
 .
 2. The preferred methods are numerical simulations, either the
 Metropolis, heat-bath or over-relaxation methods. In a
 numerical computation the lattice must be finite, say ND, so
 that there are both infrared and ultraviolet cutoffs. As a
 decreases, if the volume is unchanged in physical units, then
 N must increase. So the number of degrees of freedom
 increases as ND, leading to a rapid increase in computer time
 requirements.

 Does QCD confine?
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 ◮ You do not build new formulations in order to answer the
 same old questions. The unanswered big question for
 perturbation theory is whether non-Abelian gauge theories
 confine. Wilson framed the question in terms of the potential
 between two static quarks, V(r).
 ◮ In the 60’s it was discovered that the known Hadron spectrum
 showed Regge behaviour, i.e., M2 ≃ J. This was shown to
 be the spectrum that arises from a spinning string of finite
 tension (although the string theory of hadrons was, and
 remains, inconsistent).
 ◮ In the 70’s it was discovered that non-Abelian fields might not
 spread out from a charge in Coulomb’s radial pattern, but
 might collapse into a flux tube. In that case one might have
 V(r) ∝ r, as for a string rather than the V(r) ∝ 1/r assumed
 in perturbation theory.

 Static quark sources
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 A quark source couples to gauge field through the term
 δS = dDxjµAµ → dDxδ(D−1)(x)A0 = dx0A0,
 where the last result is obtained after taking the limit of a static
 quark sitting at the spatial point x = 0 which has only the
 component j0. After a Wick rotation to Euclidean space, this part
 of the action reduces to a link in the time direction. The symmetry
 of Euclidean rotations can then be used to rotate these into any
 direction one chooses.
 As a result, a static quark (or antiquark) source can be represented
 in the lattice theory as a sequence of gauge fields U along the path
 taken by the quark.

 Confinement and glueballs
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 If V(r) ∝ r then logW(r,T) ∝ rT. This is called the area law.
 This is obtained at strong coupling because the expectation value
 of a Wilson loop is proportional to the number of plaquettes it
 contains. If each plaquette expectation value is p, then
 W(r,T) ≃ prT.
 The correlation function between colour singlet operators is
 mediated by objects called glueballs. If −logW(r,T) ≃ σrT, i.e.,
 the string tension is σ, then the correlation function of L2 sized
 loops separated by distance r is given by
 C(r,L) ≃ exp(−4σrL),
 i.e., the glueball correlations fall exponentially, and the glueball
 mass is 4σL.
 This is not a proof of confinement for QCD because the strong
 coupling phase does not have a continuum limit due to string
 roughening.

 Gauge theories at finite temperature
 The statistical mechanics of a gauge theory is examined by
 evaluating the partition function with periodic boundary conditions
 in the Euclidean time direction and sending the spatial size to
 infinity (the thermodynamic limit). In practice one computes on
 a Nt ×ND−1
 s
 lattice with T = 1/(aNt) and limit L = Nsa ≫ 1/T.
 At finite temperature the action has a global symmetry under
 multiplication of time-like links by any element of the center, of
 the gauge group i.e.,
 if U′
 t(x) = zUt(x), then S[U′] = S[U].
 To check this, note that if U → zU then U† → z−1U†. As a result
 each plaquette is invariant, and hence the action is invariant.
 If the center of the gauge group is non-trivial (i.e., contains more
 than just the identity) then one can investigate whether this global
 symmetry is broken or restored as the temperature changes.

 The Metropolis algorithm and acceptance rates
 The Metropolis and Heat-Bath algorithms continually bring each
 degree of freedom into equilibrium with its neighbours at a given
 β. For every link with value U, one suggests a random new value
 U′ and accepts it with the Metropolis probability
 p =min 1,eβ∆S , where ∆S =S[U′]−S[U].
 Some measure of the distance between U and U′, δ = |U′ −U′| is
 tuned so that the acceptance rate in equilibrium, p β, is around
 80%. Extremely high or low acceptance rates mean that the
 movement in configuration space is very slow. It would be an
 useful exercise to measure p β as a function of δ and try to find
 invariance principles as the bare coupling, β is changed.
 SG

 The heat-bath algorithm
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 If all neighbours of a single link are kept fixed, while it is
 repeatedly updated by Metropolis, then asymptotically it reaches a
 certain “thermal” distribution. Heat-bath (HB) algorithms are set
 up to sample this in one step.
 For an Ising model if the spin of interest is s, and the sum over all
 neighbouring spins is h, then the limiting probabilities are
 p(s) = e−βhs
 2coshβh .
 The Ising HB is simply to set s = ±1 with the above probabilities.
 For the U(1) group there is an HB due to Bunk (B. Bunk,
 unpublished), a fast HB specific to SU(2) (A. D. Kennedy and B. J.
 Pendleton, Phys. Lett., B156, 393, 1985), and a method for extending
 this to any SU(N) (N. Cabibbo and E. Marinari, Phys. Lett., B119,

 Critical slowing down
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 The rate at which the whole lattice moves through configuration
 space can be observed by a damage spreading exercise. (S. Gupta,
 Nucl. Phys., B370, 741, 1992)
 Make a copy of a configuration, C, and change it by a large
 amount in exactly one link. Call this configuration C′. Now
 subject C and C′ to Monte Carlo evolution and compare them at
 the end of each sweep. The damage front is that region of the
 lattice through which the difference between the two
 configurations is much larger than δ. For the Metropolis and
 Heat-Bath algorithms this spread is diffusive, i.e., the radius of the
 damage front changes as √t. This means that measurements are
 strongly correlated over time scales proportional to R2.
 The damage front stalls when R ≃ ξ, so global (thermodynamic)
 averages are correlated at time scales of the order of ξ2.
 SG

 The Over-Relaxation Algorithm
 In the over-relaxation (OR) algorithm we move the link as much as
 possible without changing the action, i.e., we solve S[U′] = S[U]
 for the new value, U′. A new value is accepted with the probability
 dU′/dU, i.e., in the ratio of the Haar measures at the two points.
 This ensures detailed balance. (OR)
 Since OR does not change the action, one has to intersperse it
 with an occasional heat-bath (HB) sweep. Typically one takes Nor
 sweeps of OR per sweep of HB. A damage spreading computation
 shows that the damage radius grows linearly with the number of
 sweeps as long as Nor is of the order of the correlation length. (U.

 Renormalized couplings
 Yang-Mills Confinement Freedom Simulation Continuum
 The bare coupling of SU(N) gauge theory is given by g2
 B = 2N/β.
 The renormalized coupling, g, can be found by measurement of
 some reference quantity on the lattice and using its perturbation
 expansion to define g. This reference is often taken to be the
 plaquette since it is easy to measure. (G. P. Lepage, P. B. Mackenzie,
 Phys. Rev., D48, 2250, 1993)
 Such a measurement gives g at the scale of a. As one changes β
 one changes a and hence the renormalized coupling g2. The
 beta-function measures the change in g2 with changing a. When a
 is small enough, the renormalized coupling should be so small that
 one can use 2-loop beta-function

 Find the bare coupling, βc, at which a lattice with fixed Nt shows
 the deconfinement transition. At this bare coupling a = 1/(NtTc).
 Measure αS at this bare coupling. Then change Nt to N′ t, measure
 the new critical bare coupling, β′ c and corresponding renormalized
 coupling α′
 S. The ratio of lattice spacings then gives
 N′ t
 Nt 
= R[1/(4πβ0αS)]
 R[1/(4πβ0α′

 By increasing Nt in steps, one can find how small the lattice
 spacing has to be before 2-loop scaling begins to work.

 Euclidean Dirac Fermions in D = 4
 The Dirac Hamiltonian in Euclidean D = 4 space-time, acting on
 4-component Dirac spinors, Ψ(x), is
 H =mβ−iαj∂j, where {β,αj} = 0, {αi,αj} = 2δij,
 the braces denote anti-commutators, and Latin subscripts run over
 the three spatial directions. We choose β and αj to be Hermitean.
 On the lattice we replace the derivative operator by the forward
 difference as before, and find
 H =
 x
 mΨ†(x)βΨ(x)+ i
 2 j 
Ψ†(x +ˆ j)αjΨ(x)−Ψ†(x)αjΨ(x +ˆ j) .
 Fourier transforms block diagonalize the Hamiltonian and give

 In the limit k → 0 one finds the correct dispersion relation
 Ek =±√
 m2 +k2. However, sin2kj vanishes not only when kj = 0
 but also at each edge of the Brillouin zone, i.e., kj = ±π.
 Therefore, each corner of the Brillouin zone contains one copy of
 the Dirac Fermion with the correct dispersion relation. This is
 Fermion doubling.
 Keeping the quadratic form H = xy Ψ†(y)MΨ(x), the
 degeneracy can be lifted by changing the Dirac operator M.

 Spin-diagonalization of fermions
 The action, S, for fermion fields Ψ(x) is given by

 M(x,y) = mδxy + 1
 2 µ 
γµ(δx+ˆ µ,y −δx−ˆ µ,y),
 and γ0 = β and γk = −iγ0αk. We can make a change of variables
 called spin diagonalization, Ψ(x) = A(x)ψ(x), where A(x) are
 4 ×4 unitary matrices such that

 Staggered (Kogut-Susskind) fermions
 The transformed Dirac operator becomes

 2 µ 
αµ(x)(δx+ˆ µ,y −δx−ˆ µ,y),
 which is a multiple of the identity. Hence one can thin the degrees
 of freedom and keep only a single component of the field at each
 site. The 16 1-component fermions at the corners of the Brillouin
 zone can be interpreted as 4 tastes of 4-component fermions. The
 Dirac components have been distributed across 24 sites of the
 lattice which collapse to a single point in the continuum.
 In the limit m → 0 the field on the odd sublattice ( µxµ = odd)
 connects only to that on the even lattice. Hence there is an exact
 global U(1) × U(1) chiral symmetry
 ψ(x ∈ odd) → Uoψ(x),

 Some general considerations
 Formulations Propagators Cite
 The Fermion action is generally the quadratic form with a 4 × 4
 matrix M,
 S = 1
 V p 
Ψ(p)M(p)Ψ(p),
 where the inverse of M is the fermion propagator. The zeroes of
 M correspond to the poles of the propagator, and give the particle
 content of the action. Chiral symmetry implies that in the
 massless case the transformation Ψ → exp(iαγ5)Ψ would lead to
 M →−γ5Mγ5. In addition one has hypercubic (rotational)
 symmetry and reflection positivity.
 One makes the additional technical assumption of the locality of
 M(x,y), which translates to a statement of F(p) falling sufficiently
 fast at large p, so that the propagator is continuous. Then with
 periodic (or anti-periodic) boundary conditions, M(p) must be
 periodic on the Brillouin zone and therefore have 16 zeroes.

 No neutrinos on the lattice

 The Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem states that if the lattice
 Hamiltonian for Weyl fermions satisfies
 1. translation invariance,
 2. locality (the Fourier transform of the kernel has continuous
 derivatives)
 3. Hermiticity
 4. any exactly conserved charges are local, have discrete
 quantum numbers and have bilinear currents
 then there are equal number of left-handed and right-handed
 particles for every value of the charge.

 Why inversion?
 Formulations Propagators Cite
 Meson correlation functions are objects like
 Cπ(x) = 
ψ(x)γ5ψ(x)
 ψ(0)γ5ψ(0) = Trγ5M−1(0,x)γ5M−1(x,0) .
 Since one cannot program Grassman valued sources efficiently, one
 cannot write down local operators whose correlators will be
 saturated by meson states. Instead, every fermionic measurement
 requires finding the inverse of the Dirac operator.
 There are fast matrix inversion methods which scale as the third
 power of the size of the matrix, N. However, since the size of the
 Dirac operator is proportional to the number of sites on the lattice,
 these generic methods are too slow for the fermion problem.
 Instead one utilizes the fact that the Dirac operator is very sparse
 (since it is essentially a first derivative operator).
 Sparse matrices can be dealt with very efficiently, for example
 inverting a tri-diagonal matrix is linear in N.

 Changing the problem

 The fastest way to solve Ax = b is the conjugate gradient (CG)
 algorithm, if A is Hermitean and positive definite (M is not, but
 M†M is, so we solve M†Mx = M†b instead of Mx = b). What we
 actually do by the CG is to solve the equivalent problem of
 minimizing f (x) = x†Ax/2 − b†x +c. This approach follows

 The solution of Ax = 0 is x = (0,0), which is where the minimum
 lies. The eigenvalues of A are 5 and 3, the eigenvector
 corresponding to the former is v5 = (1,1)/√2 and to the latter is
 v3 = (1,−1)/√2.

 The steepest descent method
 Formulations Propagators Cite
 We will construct an iterative process which will be stopped as
 soon as the solution, xi, is good enough for use. The error is
 ǫi = x∗ −xi where x∗ is the solution and the residual is
 ri = b−Axi. Clearly, ri = Aǫi. Importantly, ri = −f ′(xi), so the
 residual is the direction of the steepest descent.
 The method of steepest descent is simple. If one has reached xi
 then, by the above argument, xi+1 = xi + αri. The value of α is
 chosen to reach the minimum along a line, i.e., f ′(xi+1) ri = 0.
 For the quadratic form, one has
 0 =ri (b−Axi+1) = ri (ri −αAri), so α = ri ri
 ri Ari .
 Finally, we have ri+1 = b − Axi+1, and the recursion is completely
 set up. Matrix-vector multiplication (MvM) twice per iteration!
 Using p = Ari and ri+1 = ri −αp, MvM once per iteration.

 The conjugate directions algorithm
 In the steepest descent method our search direction was ri. We
 switch to a set of mutually conjugate pi, i.e., pi Apj = δij. Taking
 the iteration xi+1 = xi + αpi, the minimization condition becomes
 ri+1 pi = 0. As a result, one finds
 αi = pi ri
 pi Api = pi Aǫi
 pi Api .
 Note that ǫi+1 = ǫi −αpi. Does the iteration converge in N steps?
 Decompose ǫ0 = ξkdk. Since pk are mutually conjugate, we find
 ξk = pk Aǫ0
 pk Apk = pk A(ǫ0+ j<kαjpj)
 pk Apk
 =−αk.
 So, the conjugate directions method cuts away the components of
 ǫ0 one by one, and converges in N steps.

 The conjugate gradient construction
 The CG corresponds to constructing the pi from the set of ri
 already generated. If so, and previous steps gave residuals r0, r1,
 , ri−1, then ri is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by them,
 since pi rj = pi Aǫj = 0 if i < j. As a result, the ri are
 orthogonal to each other, so rj is always a new search direction.
 Since ri are linear combinations of previous residuals and Api, the
 subspace spanned by them is also spanned by r0, Ar0, A2r0, etc..
 This is called a Krylov space.
 The conjugate directions can be constructed by a Gram-Schmidt
 process (with “metric” A) in general, but because of the
 orthogonalities here, one step suffices. As a result
 pi+1 = ri+1 +βi+1pi, where βi+1 = ri+1 ri+1
 ri ri .
 The immense simplification is that the previous vectors do not
 have to stored for Gram-Schmidt conjugation

 Putting everything together, the algorithm is initialized with
 p0 = r0 =b−Ax0. Then the iteration is

 xi+1 = xi +αpi
 ri+1 = ri −αpi
 β = ri+1 ri+1

 pi+1 = ri+1+βpi.
 There is only one MvM per step, and two dot products (the ri ri
 can be saved from the previous iteration). MvM is easy to
 parallelize, but the dot products break parallel execution.

 History of the conjugate gradient algorithm
 “The method of conjugate gradients was developed independently
 by E. Stiefel of the Institute of Applied Mathematics at Z¨ urich and
 by M. R. Hestenes with the cooperation of J. B. Rosser, G.
 Forsythe, and L. Paige of the Institute for Numerical Analysis,
 National Bureau of Standards. The present account was prepared
 jointly by M. R. Hestenes and E. Stiefel during the latter’s stay at
 the National Bureau of Standards. The first papers on this method
 were given by E. Stiefel [1952] and by M. R. Hestenes [1951].
 Reports on this method were given by E. Stiefel and J. B. Rosser at
 a Symposium on August 23-25, 1951. Recently, C. Lanczos [1952]
 developed a closely related routine based on his earlier paper on
 eigenvalue problem [1950]. Examples and numerical tests of the
 method have been by R. Hayes, U. Hoschstrasser, and M. Stein.”
