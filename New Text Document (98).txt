 Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for extragalactic axion
like DM. Given a DM density profile of FRB 20220912A’s host, we obtain upper limits on the
 ALP-photon coupling constant of gaγ <(3.4×10−11−1.9×10−9)GeV−1 for the ALP masses

 distance scales, complementary to galactic DM probes.
 Oneofthemostimportanttasksthat remain unresolved in modern physics
 is the detection of dark matter particles (DM, hereafter referring to dark
 matter rather than dispersion measure), and numerous candidates of DM
 have been proposed. Axion-like particles (ALPs), a type of ultralight
 bosons, have emerged as the most prevailing candidates in the search for
 DM1–6. Thanks to the special properties of ultralight scalar particles
 (ma ~10−22eV), they can provide a natural solution to the challenges
 encountered in small-scale structures of the Universe7–9. A lot of strate
gies for finding axion-like DM have been explored, including photons
 from axion conversion10–13, nuclear magnetic resonance14,15, periodic
 oscillations of linearly polarized light16–20, and other terrestrial or astro
nomical experiments21,22.
 Laγ ¼
 Among the various axion-like DM detection methods, detecting per
iodic oscillations of polarized light has been regarded as a promising
 approach in astrophysics16–20,23–27. When light propagates through the ALP
 f
 ield, photons would interact with ALPs, and the interaction term is

 ~ Fμν ,wheregaγrepresentsthecouplingstrengthbetweenthe
 axion field (a) and the electromagnetic field (Fμν). The interaction leads to
 modifications in the dispersion relations28,29. The left- and right-handed
 circular polarization modes of light experience opposite corrections due to
 their different dispersion relations. This effect is known as cosmic bire
fringence, resulting in changes in the polarization angles (PAs) of the light.
 Therefore, in the presence of an ALPfield,ifthe light is linearly polarized, its
 PAs will oscillate with the ALP field, with an amplitude proportional to gaγ.
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief and intense radio transients that
 originate from cosmological distances30–36. FRBs have been powerful
 astrophysical laboratories for studying cosmology37–48 and also have the
 potential to play an important role in the detection of DM25,49–56.Todate,no
 studies have utilized real polarization observations of FRBs to constrain
 axion-like DMdirectly.ThenecessaryconditionsforFRBstoserveasaxion
like DM probes include: (i) active repeating bursts, (ii) nonmagneto-ionic
 local environments with stable PAs, (iii) highly linear polarization, and (iv)
 precise localizations within host galaxies. The repetition pattern of FRBs
 enables us to monitor their polarization properties long-term to detect
 axion-like DM on extragalactic distance scales, complementary to other
 galactic DM probes. The schematic illustration is shown in Fig. 1.One
 intriguing sample for such a study is FRB 20220912A, an active repeating
 source with highly linear polarization57,58, and its local environment is
 nonmagneto-ionic59. Its long-term polarization observations from the Five
hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST)58 provide a
 remarkable opportunity to detect extragalactic axion-like DM through
 searching for a periodic oscillation in the PAs.

 Discussion
 In this work, we attempted to detect extragalactic ALPs in the host
 galaxies of the hyperactive repeating FRBs. Thanks to the nonmagneto
ionic local environment, highly linear polarization, and relatively stable
 PAs within the observation period, FRB 20220912A is hitherto the most
 suitable repeating source for carrying out such a study. Note that
 the distance of FRBs does not provide an advantage in detecting axion
like DM. This is because the PA shift depends on the axion field at the
 initial
 and final positions, independent of the propagation
 distance (see Equation (3) in Methods). With the state-of-the-art PAs
 observations of the bursts from the repeating source FRB 20220912A
 taken by FAST, we obtained upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling
 constant of gaγ < (3.4×10−11−1.9×10−9)GeV−1 for the ALP masses
 ma ~(1.4×10−21 −5.2×10−20) eV. If the polarization observations of
 FRB 20220912A are expected to last for one year, the gaγ limit would be
 gaγ <3.3×10−12GeV−1 for an ALP mass ma ~1.4×10−22eV.
 Although the constraints on gaγ from FRBs are not as competitive as
 those from other sources, such as the active galaxies16, the quasar
 H1821+643 and the cosmic microwave background74,75, and the mass
 range of ma <2×10−21eV have been excluded by the Lyman-α Forest
 Data76, our attempt can serve as an alternative and complementary
 method. FRBs have the advantage of being abundant in extragalactic
 systems. Numerous extragalactic FRBs offer an alternative way to detect
 axion-like DM in various DM-rich extragalactic systems, thereby
 obtaining tighter constraints on gaγ that complement other galactic DM
 probes, such as pulsars.
 In the era of Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a largesample of localized
 FRBs will significantly enhance their applications. When numerous FRBs
 are combined, the constrained precision on the ALP-photon coupling
 constant will statistically increase by a factor of ffiffiffiffi

 p .According to Zhang
 et al.48, Oð105Þ-Oð106Þ FRBs can be detected by the mid-frequency array of
 thefirstphaseofSKA(SKA1-MID)ina10-yearobservationperiod.Todate,
 more than 800 FRBs have been detected77, and among them, only one, FRB
 20220912A,hasbeenidentifiedasarepeatingFRBwithanonmagneto-ionic
 environment. Assuming there are N~100(0.1%ofthetotal)FRBslike FRB
 20220912A in SKA1-MID, the upper limit of the coupling constant would
 improve by approximately an order of magnitude.
 It should be underlined here that the implicit assumption on our
 results is that the ALP mass exceeds the Hubble parameter in the
 appropriate epoch of the Universe. In this condition, the ALP-induced
 PA oscillations can begin and lead to an evolution of energy density in
 the form of DM5,9. If the ALP mass is so low that it approaches the

 the rotation of the polarization plane, known as cosmic birefringence.

 that the PAshiftϕis determinedbythetime-dependent axion field a(x,t)at
 the initial and final positions, since it arises from the path integral of the
 axion field gradient (∂μa). The equation of motion for the ALP fieldisgiven
 by the Klein-Gordon equation. When we neglect the friction term, the
 solution simplifies and exhibits an oscillating form:

 by T=2π/ma,which depends on the ALP mass. If the energy density of the

 DMdensity profile of the host galaxy
 Outside the solitonic cores of galaxies, the DM density distribution ρ(r)can
 be approximately described by the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White
 (NFW) profile81:

 whereristhedistancefromthegalaxycenter, ρ0isthecharacteristic density,
 rs is the scale radius, and β is the power-law index. Also, ρ(r) ∝ r−β when
 r ≪rs and ρ(r) ∝ rβ−3 when r ≫ rs.Forthecaseofβ =1,Equation(6)is
 reduced to the original NFW profile82. In principle, these coefficients (ρ0, rs,
 and β) can be determined by fitting the rotation curves of galaxies. The
 physical origins of FRBs are still unknown, but some of them have been
 localized in extragalactic host galaxies.Oncewehaveenoughobservational
 information aboutthe FRBhostgalaxy,wecanestimatetheDMdensityρin
 the vicinity of the FRB source.
 The Deep Synoptic Array localized the repeater FRB 20220912A to a
 host galaxy, PSO J347.2702 +48.7066, at redshift z =0.077157.Thehost
 galaxyhasastellarmassofapproximately1010 M⊙, a star-formation rate of
 ≳0.1M⊙yr−1, and an effective radius of 2.2 kpc. Gordon et al.83 compared
 the optical host luminosities of repeating and nonrepeating FRBs across
 redshift, and definedademarcationatluminosity109 L⊙belowwhichahost
 can be classified as a dwarf galaxy. FRB 20220912A sits just above the
 borderline at ≈1.1 × 109 L⊙,suggestingthatitshostmaybeadwarfgalaxy83.
 Since they have higher fractions of DM compared to more massive
 systems, dwarf galaxies are deemed as ideal systems to probe the DM density
 profile84. However, we currently lack rotation curve observations of the host
 of FRB 20220912A to investigate its DM density distribution. Here we use the
 DMdensity profile of a dwarf galaxy, NGC 4451 (with a similar stellar mass
 of ~1010 M⊙andasimilar radius of ~ 2.2 kpc84), as a reference. Note that the
 differences in DM density profiles between NGC 4451 and FRB 20220912A’s
 host have negligible effects within the precision range of our study. Based on
 the stellar rotation curve, Cooke et al.84 determined the coefficients of the
 generalized NFW profile (Equation (6)) for NGC 4451, i.e.,
 ρ0 =0.41M⊙pc−3, rs =2.2kpc, andβ = 0. Furthermore, a recent milli
arcsecond localization of FRB 20220912A shows that its transverse offset
 from the host galaxy center is r≈0.8 kpc85. With this information, an estimate
 of the DM density at the location of FRB 20220912A from Equation (6)is
 ρ ~0.16 M⊙pc−3. This value is much larger than the DM density near our
 Earth, which is ~ 0.01 M⊙pc−3 estimated by the Galactic NFW profile86.
 The PADataAnalysis
 The PAs of FRB 20220912A were derived from the raw data of FAST. The
 central frequency, bandwidth, number offrequency channels,andsampling
 time for the raw data were 1.25 GHz, 0.5GHz, 4096, and 49.152μs,
 respectively. We used the GPU-accelerated transient search software HEIM
DALL and processed the data on FAST’s high-performance computer facil
ities. A dispersion measure range of 200 to 250pc cm−3wassearched, with a
 signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 6.5 and a maximum boxcar of 512. After
 determining the dispersion measures, the de-dispersed polarization data
 were calibrated using the PSRCHIVE software package with correction for
 differential gain and phase between the receivers achieved through the
 injection of a noise diode signal before each observation. The rotation of the
 telescope and the variation of the receiver across the days were calibrated
 through PAC. TheRMwassearchedfrom −2000to2000radm−2instepsof
 1radm−2 using the RMFIT program87. Ionospheric RMs in the direction of
 FRB 20220912A at each burst’s arrival time were computed using FRion
 package88. The ionosphere model is sourced from the International GNSS
 Service (IGS), which provides ionosphere vertical total electron content
 (TEC) maps daily. FRion downloads these TEC maps from NASA CDDIS
 archive. After correcting thedatawiththebest-fittedRMs,wederivethePAs
 of the linearly polarized component. During a total of 9.2 hours of obser
vations between October 28th, 2022 and December 5th, 2022 (corre
sponding to MJD 59880 and MJD 59918), we obtain 674 bursts with RM
 measurements. The PA data of these bursts are available in Supplemen
tary Data 1.
 The standard deviation of PAs
 Variations in PAs of FRBs are complex and puzzling89–91.Theprevailing
 understandingisthatthesevariationsaremainlyattributedtothesignificant

 axion-like DM exits in the host galaxy and envelops the FRB sources, the
 observed PA (ϕobs) isexpectedtobecomposedof twocomponents:one
 from the PA contribution of the astrophysical background (e.g., the mag
netic field), ϕbkg, and the other one is the ALP-induced PA shift, ϕ(t), i.e.,

 ð7Þ
 where〈ϕbkg〉represents the meanvalueofthePAcausedbythebackground
 magneticfield andΔϕbkgcorrespondstothePAfluctuationarisingfromthe
 magnetic field changes. Since Δϕbkg is unpredictable, we simply assume that
 the magnetic field is time-invariant, which means that the observed PA
 f
 luctuations are attributed to the ALP-photon coupling effect, i.e.,
 ϕobs = 〈ϕbkg〉 + ϕ(t). Actually, the fluctuations caused by time-varying
 magnetic fields are quite real, which means that ignoring the contribution
 from Δϕbkg will conduct conservative upper limits on the ALP-photon
 coupling constant gaγ for different ALP masses, except in a case of
 coincidences where ϕ(t)andΔϕbkg cancel out in opposite phases.
 Giventherandomnessofthevalueofthephaseδ(seeEquation(5)),we

The influence of the circular polarization degree

 NGC4451 (purple solid line) with a 95% confidence region (gray shade). The
 relation between the dark matter (DM) density ρ(r) and the distance r from the
 galaxy center is displayed (see Equation (6)). The location of FRB 20220912A (red
 dashed line) and the estimated DM density near our Earth based on the Galactic
 NFWprofile (orange dashed line) are indicated.
 The influence of the Faraday rotation
 Stable PAs are essential requirements for our study. For most FRBs, the
 dominant mechanism of PA variation is the Faraday rotation effect when
 propagating through magnetizedplasma. The RMisacrucial parameter for
 quantifying this effect. The PAs induced by Faraday rotation can be
 expressed as ϕ =RM(c/ν)2,wherec is the light speed and ν is the frequency.
 In our FRB 20220912A dataset, the mean value of the daily median RM is
 〈RMMed〉=−0.91±1.12radm−2.SuchasmallRMmayimplythattheRM
 contribution from its host galaxy is comparable to that of the Milky Way58,
 whichis ~−16radm−293.Nevertheless,theRMfromthegalacticmediumis
 stable and thus has negligible influence. Additionally, the long-term varia
tion of RMis also stable58, with a slope of 0.017 rad m−2 day−1 (0.06° day−1).
 TheSDofALP-inducedPAshiftis ~2°atamassof10−21eV, whichcanbe
 estimated using Equation (8). If the Faraday rotation contributes a com
parable PA shift, the RM needs to reach ~ 0.6 rad m−2.TheSDof〈RMMed〉
 for FRB 20220912A is comparable with this value. This indicates that
 although it is reasonable to disregard the PA caused by the magnetic field in
 our analysis, the influence of the Faraday rotation prevents us from further
 improving accuracy.
 Despite the highly linear polarization observed in FRB 20220912A, obser
vations have shown that this source also exhibits a fraction of circular
 polarization. The possible explanations include intrinsic radiation
 mechanisms94,95
 or propagation effects within a magnetar’s
 magnetosphere96,97. To investigate the influence of the circular polarization
 degree, we calculate the cumulative probability distribution of the linear
 polarization degree of 674 bursts and employ the SD method to quantify
 constraint results. Figure 6 presents the cumulative probability distribution
 of linear polarization, which showsthatover80%ofburstshavealinear
 polarization fraction exceeding 90%. After removing those PA data below a
 given linear polarization threshold, we can calculate the coupling constant
 gaγ for the remainingPAdata.Thisgaγvalueisthendividedbythatobtained
 from the total PA dataset for normalization. Taking the linear polarization
 threshold from 60% to 100%, the relative variations of gaγ are also depicted
 in Fig. 6. The absenceof asignificant reduction in gaγafterremoving the low
 polarization degree data suggests that non-linearly polarized data have little
 impact on our results.
 The influence of the Dark matter density
 TheassumptionofDMdensityemployedinthispaperisapproximate,butit
 canbeshownthatitsimpactonourresultsisnegligible.Theprecisionofthe
 VLBI localization corresponds to a physical length of less than 10 pc85,
 allowing us to disregard the location error. The errors associated with the
 generalized NFW profile, characterized by three parameters and their
 errors, are as follows: ρ0 ¼ 0:41þ0:47
 0:24 M pc 3, rs ¼ 2:2þ0:8
 0:7 kpc, and
 β ¼0:0þ0:5
 0:6
 84. We estimate the errors in DMdensity by randomlysampling
 parameters from their error distributions. The best-fit generalized NFW
 profile of NGC 4451 and its 95% CL are shown in Fig. 7.Wefind that the
 95%CLlowerlimitofDMdensityataradiusof0.8 kpcissimilartothatnear
 the Earth. Therefore, in the worst-case scenario, the DM density is set to a
 value near the Earth (ρ ~0.01M⊙pc−3), resulting in a coupling constant
 limit gaγ that is four times larger. In general, since gaγ is proportional to the
 square root of DMdensity,anyestimation deviation in DMdensity mustbe
 significant to meaningfully affect our results.
