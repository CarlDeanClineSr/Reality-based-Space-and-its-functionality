## ðŸ§  Purpose  
 Unified Field Theory proposing that spacetime is not smooth, but a quantized lattice of coherence nodes. Energy, mass, inertia, gravity, and time all emerge from interactions across this field. This repository archives LUFT's developmentâ€”from early lightning resonance recordings to the 2025 CERN anomaly confirmations.

## ðŸ§¬ Core Discoveries  
- Spacetime is a dynamic lattice, not a neutral vacuum.  
- harmonics drives coherence across scales.  
- Preon fields are the true basis of matterâ€”quarks and leptons emerge from them.  
- Time, gravity, and inertia arise from lattice resistance and temporal friction.  
- LUFT explains 2025 CERN anomalies: muon decay asymmetry, CP violation, jet distortions, and magnetic harmonics.  
- EME and sheet-lattice experiments confirm the theory with real-world data.

 
## ðŸ“… Milestones  
-  
-  
- July 23, 2025: CERN anomalies confirm LUFT predictions (muon decays, CP asymmetry, magnetic harmonics)
