## 🧪 Simulations & Data-Driven Tests

LUFT’s power is in the math, the data, and the ideas. You’ll find:

- Jupyter Notebooks for lattice simulations and UFT equation modeling
- Python scripts for analyzing SDR recordings and field resonance
- Data folders with lightning, hydrogen line, and 7,468 Hz events

Want to contribute? Try running a simulation, analyzing a dataset, or proposing a hardware build—even if it’s “junk,” every step counts!

# LUFT — Lattice Unified Field Theory  
by Dr. Carl Dean Cline Sr.

## 🧠 Purpose  
LUFT is a Unified Field Theory proposing that spacetime is not smooth, but a quantized lattice of coherence nodes. Energy, mass, inertia, gravity, and time all emerge from interactions across this field. This repository archives LUFT's development—from early lightning resonance recordings to the 2025 CERN anomaly confirmations.

## 🧬 Core Discoveries  
- Spacetime is a dynamic lattice, not a neutral vacuum.  
- A resonance frequency of ~7,468 Hz drives coherence across scales.  
- Preon fields are the true basis of matter—quarks and leptons emerge from them.  
- Time, gravity, and inertia arise from lattice resistance and temporal friction.  
- LUFT explains 2025 CERN anomalies: muon decay asymmetry, CP violation, jet distortions, and magnetic harmonics.  
- EME and sheet-lattice experiments confirm the theory with real-world data.
