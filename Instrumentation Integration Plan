# Instrumentation Integration Plan

**LUFT/UFT Project — Instrumentation, Data Sources, and Pipeline Adaptation**

---

## Objective

To ensure the LUFT/UFT mining toolkit and analysis pipeline are fully modular, scalable, and ready for rapid integration of new missions, telescopes, detectors, and spectroscopic methods—enabling cross-comparison and discovery of unification signatures across the widest possible spectrum of astrophysical and laboratory data.

---

## 1. Primary Instruments & Data Sources

### Space-Based Observatories
- **JWST** (James Webb Space Telescope, NIRSpec, MIRI, NIRCam)
- **HST** (Hubble Space Telescope, STIS, COS, WFC3)
- **Twinkle Space Telescope** (planned for exoplanet and atmospheric spectroscopy)
- **TESS, Kepler** (time-domain photometry, transits)
- **FUSE** (Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer)

### Ground-Based & Other
- **SDSS** (Sloan Digital Sky Survey)
- **ESO/VLT, Gemini, Subaru** (high-res optical/IR)
- **LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA** (gravitational wave strain)
- **CERN ATLAS/CMS** (particle collisions, anti-matter)
- **Fermi-LAT, AMS-02** (gamma/cosmic ray)
- **Any SDR, SQUID, magnetometer, or lab-based spectral data**

---

## 2. Data Pipeline Adaptation

- **Modular Data Loader**: Each instrument/mission has a dedicated loader module (FITS, CSV, HDF5, API fetch, etc.).
- **Instrument Metadata**: All relay capsules and analysis scripts must record instrument, detector, wavelength range, and calibration context.
- **Automated Format Detection**: Scripts scan file headers or metadata to auto-select the correct parser.
- **Extensible Analysis Functions**: Signature mining, FFT, burst search, and phase analysis are instrument-agnostic, operating on normalized (wavelength, flux/intensity) arrays.
- **Relay Capsule Standardization**: Each output capsule includes a “Data Source/Instrument” section for traceability.

---

## 3. Integration Guidelines

- **Adding a New Instrument/Telescope**
  1. Implement or adapt a loader for data format (see `/tools/loaders/`).
  2. Register the instrument in the pipeline config (`/configs/instruments.yaml`).
  3. Document supported spectral/temporal ranges and unique calibration steps.
  4. Test with a known object/spectrum for ground truth.
  5. Relay capsule must reference instrument and method.

- **Community Contributions**
  - Pull requests adding new data sources or loaders must provide a sample script and data, plus a capsule showing successful mining/visualization for at least one LUFT signature.

---

## 4. Current Coverage & Priorities

- **JWST, HST, Fermi-LAT:** Supported and in pipeline.
- **Twinkle:** Stub ready for future data—see mining code.
- **CERN, LIGO:** Analysis modules in progress.
- **Other sources:** Open for extension; see `/tools/` and `/data/`.

---

## 5. Roadmap

- [ ] Complete generic data loader stubs for Twinkle, SDSS, and ESO.
- [ ] Expand mining toolkit for time-domain and multi-wavelength data.
- [ ] Integrate latest calibration and reduction techniques as published.
- [ ] Maintain an active list of new/relevant instruments in this document.
