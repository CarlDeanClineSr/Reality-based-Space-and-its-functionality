# Bridging Unification Concepts to Measurements

| Concept Layer | Operational Metric | File / Output |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Universal base resonance | Peak detection at f0 with FDR-controlled significance | peaks.csv |
| Lattice / structured energy | Harmonic & rational enrichment p-values | harmonic_enrichment.csv |
| Space-time stability | Drift of f0 (Hz/hour) & phase drift (rad/s) | peaks.csv (add drift), phase_pairs.csv |
| Cross-domain universality (RF + Magnonics) | Co-occurrence of significant f0 peak across domains | cross_domain_summary.md |
| Coherence of "energy movement" | PLV, coherence magnitude, group delay stability | phase_pairs.csv |
| Artifact rejection | Decoy null distributions (z, PLV) | decoys/*.csv |
| Scaling law of harmonics | Amplitude vs n fit to 1/n^α (estimate α) | harmonic_falloff.csv |
| Lattice pressure (speculative) | Residual term in modified field equation fit (placeholder) | lattice_pressure.csv (future) |
| Non-local correlation | Multi-station PLV & low-lag cross-correlation | phase_consensus.csv |
| Theoretical constraint drift limit | | config prereg + drift_fail flag |

## Drift Tracking
Frequency drift rate = (f_end - f_start)/duration.  
Flag if |drift_rate| > drift_max_ppm_per_hr * f0 * 1e-6 / hour.

## Future Extensions
- Bayesian model combining amplitude, coherence, phase drift into a single evidential score.
- Cross-correlation of independent environmental logs vs peak strength (confound regression).
- Null pooling across domains (RF permutations + magnonics decoys unified).
