# LUFT Resonance Atlas (RF + Magnonics Scaffold)

**Core Claim:**  
LUFT proposes that the fundamental structure of reality is a quantized lattice of coherence nodes, manifesting a universal resonance near 7,468.779 Hz. This lattice underlies the emergence and interplay of space, time, energy, and matter. By combining reproducible RF and magnonics experiments—complete with falsifiable controls—we test for universal signatures, phase coherence, and harmonic patterns that could unify quantum and cosmic phenomena.
