# Project Overview — LUFT: Unification, Structure, and Dynamics of the Underlying Construction

**Mission Statement:**  
This project is dedicated to the unification and deep investigation of the structure and dynamics of the underlying construction of reality—including the movements and interactions of energy, space, time, and matter.

**Scope:**  
- Develop and document the Lattice Unified Field Theory (LUFT)
- Explore the quantized, fractal lattice of spacetime
- Model the emergence of mass, inertia, gravity, and quantum effects from fundamental lattice interactions
- Validate with real-world data (e.g., lightning, satellite, magnetometer, FRB, and SQUID measurements)
- Provide open-source simulations, analysis, and experimental protocols for the scientific community

**Guiding Principle:**  
Everything here is about the real, constructive mechanisms that underpin the universe—not just equations, but the *movement* and *structure* of energy, space, and time at the most fundamental level.
