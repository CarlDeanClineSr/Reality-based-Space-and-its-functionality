# LUFT: Claim of Origin & Provenance

## What Is This Page?

This page documents the origin, authorship, and development timeline of **LUFT — Lattice Unified Field Theory**, as conceived and built by Dr. Carl Dean Cline Sr. It serves as a living record for attribution, historical tracing, and community transparency. If you use LUFT’s ideas, math, code, or data—credit is expected.

## 📅 Timeline of LUFT

- **1960s–2020s:** Early questions about energy, atoms, mass, and the structure of reality.  
  _Carl Cline Sr. begins contemplating energy storage, atomic structure, chain reactions, and the nature of unification._
- **2023–2025:**  
  - Thousands of hours spent in contemplation, simulation, and experimental work.
  - SDR lightning recordings, HDSDR data, and custom lab experiments.
  - LUFT code, equations, and ideas stored in Google Drive, Google Docs, Kaggle, and GitHub.
  - Chapters and chapters of chats, AI logs, lab notes, and simulations—all unified under the LUFT program.
  - Major files: [see repo contents], plus Kaggle datasets and Google Docs code.

- **July 23, 2025:** CERN anomalies (muon decays, magnetic harmonics, jet distortions) confirm LUFT’s predictions. Unification is now an actionable idea—documented and timestamped in this repository.
